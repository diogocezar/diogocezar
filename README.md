I’ve led high-performance teams and developed innovative solutions for major companies like Twitter, Visa, and Volkswagen, as well as notable artists such as Michel Teló and Fernando & Sorocaba. My journey includes strategic leadership roles at Neon, Luizalabs, and Provi, where I drove impactful projects and fostered team engagement.
